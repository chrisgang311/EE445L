EE 445L - Lecture ...

Requirements Document and System
What do you do when you're lost!??
1) Go to OH and ask questions.
2) Come to class and pay attention.

Do you actually understand what you did in the lab!?

SPI - Timing diagrams, logic analyzer, DR and DA
Sound generation && Speaker
Sampling / DAC : R-2R Ladder, Binary Weight, Resistor String (445L way), 
Nyquist Theorem 3 Frequencies and 3 Amplitudes. Range resolution precision, samp rate, num samples, freq res

Requirements Document is really, really, really important.
What goes into the system?
Microprocessor : TM4C123 with software and I/O
Enclosure: Box to hold it.
Power: Batteries, charge and on/off switch it.
Regulator: How much current do you need?
Transducer: Anything that's mechanical data collector.
Interface Electronics: connect the transducers up to the MC
Displays and Wifis.

Pay attention to the PCB schedule
PCB Ordered by 1 Month from now.  12 Noon on th 27th of October

Lab3 power

Building a part:
assigned by TA, schematic symbol:
Power on top, groun on bottom, input on left, output on right.
Save it in another library than the reuglar part.
No multiboard layouts.
